The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) is an ontology in the domain of interactions and interaction networks. INO represents general and species-neutral types of interactions and interaction networks, and their related elements and relations. INO has been used in different applications, such as the literature mining of various interaction types. 

INO is an OBO library ontology as seen:
